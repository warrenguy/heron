// ConnectResult holds session handles and ids after a successful connect handshake.
//
// On success, Poll transfers ownership of session resources into ConnectResult.
// NewAeronCluster(result) moves IngressPublication, EgressSubscription, EgressImage,
// and (when OwnsAeronClient) Aeron into the session, nils those transferred fields
// on result, and leaves cleanup to AeronCluster.Close() only - do not Close those
// handles on result after transfer.
//
// MemberIngressMap aliases the session map at NewAeronCluster time (not nilled on
// result). On leader change the session replaces its map with a newly built one;
// result.MemberIngressMap is stale. Use AeronCluster.MemberIngressMap() for the live
// map and do not cache the result field across leader changes. Do not Close or mutate
// map entries via result after transfer.
//
// At Poll success, leader MemberIngressMap publication pointers alias
// ConnectResult.IngressPublication; non-leader publications are closed before
// Poll returns. After NewAeronCluster, use AeronCluster.IngressPublication() and
// AeronCluster.MemberIngressMap() - result.IngressPublication is nilled on transfer
// while result.MemberIngressMap still aliases the live map until the first leader
// change replaces it.
//
// LeadershipTermID and LeaderMemberID are connect-time snapshots. After leader
// change use AeronCluster.LeadershipTermID and AeronCluster.LeaderMemberID for
// live values. When IngressEndpoints is unset, MemberIngressMap uses synthetic
// member id 0; do not use LeaderMemberID alone to look up channel-only ingress.
//
// Discard AsyncConnect without Close on success. On failure, call AsyncConnect.Close.
